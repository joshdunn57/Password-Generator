# Password Generator

***

During this challenge, I was given the task to generate a password for a user. The user is prompted with input, asking them how they prefer their password to look. If they do not follow the prompt guidelines, the user is asked again to genereate a stronger password.

## Work Completed 
*** 
* Created 4 variables containing possible characters in the password
* Prompted and confirmed the user to multiple questions on how they want to customize their password
* If the user wanted a type of character, I added the type to a seperate variable
* Randomized the characters chosen using the Math.random function
* Returned the finished password
